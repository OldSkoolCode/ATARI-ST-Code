The GEM libraries have bee completly finished, and here are the details.

The GEM libraries for Mark Johnson's 'C' Compiler have been split into two
libraries now known as AES.A & VDI.A.  The AES.A library of course contains
AES routines, but also contains the startup code for a gem program.  You will
have to use this library when assembling unless you rewrite the startup code.
The VDI.A library contains all of the VDI stuff needed.  The PRG.S file was also
updated to accomadate the rest of the library routines.  The last file is 
MKP.BAT file was changed so that the two libraries will assemble with the 
program file. The reason the files were not put together is the fact that the 
compiler is only a beta version and still has a few bugs to work out.  
Therefore, the compiler can handle these files seperatly but not when put 
together.  Also note, that these libraries are not extensively tested.  When I
can get a hold of the assembler opcodes I then can test them to make sure the 
work correctly.  Isn't public domain programs great.  If Mark Johnson will 
agree, I will keep GEnie updated with GEM libraries for his compiler.  I guess 
kind of a technical advisor for the 'C' compiler for the GEM side.  I feel, I 
am experienced enough to deal with any problems should they arise with the 'C' 
compiler.  If anyone would like to see my credentials, then just write me a 
letter, using GE mail.
